# Steady/Transient States on Flutter with Bloc

Testing the steady/transient states. More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_state).

The main idea is to have two type of states: steady states, which should cause a rebuild (e.g. from loading to loaded), and transient states, which should not trigger an entire rebuild, but instead make small UI changes (e.g. increase a progress indicator) or interact with other parts of the system.
